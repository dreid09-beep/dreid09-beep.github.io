			<h3>Story Idea and Why It Matters</h3>
			<!-- Add image below this comment -->
			<img src="newhouse.jpg" alt="an image of the Newhouse School of Communications" height="300px" width="400px">
			<p>This project will explore how New York City’s crime landscape has changed since the
			COVID-19 pandemic. Public perception often suggests that crime has risen dramatically, yet data may tell a more nuanced story. By analyzing official records of arrests, shootings, jail populations, and re-arrest rates, this project aims to uncover which boroughs or neighborhoods have experienced the biggest shifts in crime trends and whether policy changes, such as bail reform, have affected outcomes. This story matters to a news audience because crime and justice remain central political and social concerns. Accurate reporting based on city data can clarify misconceptions, provide context for public safety debates, and show the human impact of criminal justice policies on New Yorkers</p>

			<h3>Dataset Summary</h3>
			<p> The data comes from the NYC Mayor’s Office of Criminal Justice, a credible city agency that compiles monthly data from the NYPD, New York City courts, and Department of Correction. The dataset includes information on reported crimes, arrests, jail admissions, recidivism, and more. It is updated regularly and offers transparency through data dictionaries and notes explaining collection methods and policy definitions. This combination of timeliness, locality, and scope makes it an ideal foundation for a data journalism story.</p>

			<h3>Analysis Plan</h3>
			<p>The analysis will filter for booster dose data and calculate vaccination rates by state, race/ethnicity, and age. Percent changes from previous years will show whether uptake is declining. Supplementary data from the CDC or Census Bureau may be merged to explore links between vaccination rates and hospitalization or income. Cleaning steps will include removing missing values and verifying consistency in state reporting</p>
