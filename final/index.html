			<h3>COVID-19 Vaccine Completion Rates Reveal Racial Gaps</h3>

			<p>The data show clear racial disparities in COVID-19 vaccine series completion across the United States. As of May 2023, completion rates ranged from about 45% to 66.4%, with Non-Hispanic Asian Americans reporting the highest rate at 66.4%, followed closely by American Indian and Alaska Native populations at 65.2%. In contrast, Non-Hispanic Black Americans reported one of the lowest completion rates at 45%, highlighting a substantial gap in vaccine uptake compared with several other racial and ethnic groups.

			Public health experts say these differences are driven largely by long-standing structural inequities rather than individual vaccine hesitancy. Black Americans have historically faced barriers to health care access, including fewer nearby medical facilities, limited transportation options, and less access to paid time off, making it more difficult to complete a multi-dose vaccine series. These access challenges were compounded during the pandemic, particularly for individuals working in frontline or hourly jobs with inflexible schedules.

			Historical and ongoing medical racism has also contributed to lower levels of trust in health institutions among Black Americans. Past unethical medical practices and persistent disparities in treatment have shaped skepticism toward government-led health initiatives, including COVID-19 vaccination campaigns. Meanwhile, groups with higher completion rates, such as Asian American and American Indian populations, often benefited from more targeted outreach efforts and community-based vaccination programs, which helped improve access and trust.

			Together, the data and research suggest that disparities in vaccine completion reflect broader inequalities in the U.S. health care system, emphasizing the need for sustained investment in equitable access and community-centered public health strategies.</p>

			<h3>Dataset Summary</h3>
			<p> This analysis uses publicly available data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to examine COVID-19 vaccine series completion rates by race and ethnicity in the United States. The dataset measures the percentage of people within each racial and ethnic group who completed the primary COVID-19 vaccine series, defined as receiving all required doses of an initial vaccination regimen. As of May 2023, completion rates ranged from approximately 45% to 66.4%, revealing significant variation across racial and ethnic groups.

			Non-Hispanic Asian Americans reported the highest vaccine series completion rate at 66.4%, followed by American Indian and Alaska Native Americans at 65.2% and Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander Americans at 64.5%. Multiracial, non-Hispanic individuals had a completion rate of 62.2%. In contrast, Hispanic or Latino Americans reported a completion rate of 57.3%, while Non-Hispanic White Americans were at 51.9%. The lowest completion rates were observed among Non-Hispanic Black Americans and those categorized as Non-Hispanic “Other,” both at 45%..</p>

				<h2>About the CDC.gov Data</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>The data were collected and published by the CDC through its COVID-19 vaccination tracking systems, which compile reports from state, territorial, tribal, and local health departments. Vaccination status is self-reported or recorded through health care providers and immunization registries, and racial and ethnic categories follow federal reporting standards. While the data provide a broad national overview, the CDC notes that reporting may be incomplete for some groups and that access to vaccination and data collection varies by location.

					Despite these limitations, the dataset offers one of the most comprehensive looks at racial and ethnic differences in COVID-19 vaccine completion and is widely used by public health researchers to identify disparities and guide policy decisions.</li>

		<li>Key insights from the interview:<li>

		<li>- Vaccine completion rates were strongly influenced by access issues, especially for people working hourly or frontline jobs who had difficulty scheduling follow-up doses.<li>

		<li>- Medical mistrust did not appear overnight during the pandemic but reflects long-standing experiences of unequal treatment within the health care system.<li>

		<li>- Community-based vaccination efforts, such as pop-up clinics and partnerships with local organizations, were more effective at increasing vaccine uptake than large, centralized sites.<li>

		<li>“When we talk about lower vaccination rates in Black communities, it’s important to understand that this isn’t about a lack of concern for health. It’s about access, trust, and whether people feel the health care system is actually working for them.”<li></p>

		</section>
		Why This Perspective Matters: The interview reinforces what the CDC data show by adding context to the numbers. While the data highlight disparities in vaccine completion rates across racial and ethnic groups, the interview helps explain how structural barriers and historical mistrust shaped those outcomes. Together, the data and firsthand expertise provide a clearer picture of why vaccine inequities persist and what strategies may be effective in addressing them.
